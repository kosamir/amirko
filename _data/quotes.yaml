    Ultimately, you must forget about technique.
    The further you progress, the fewer teachings there are.

    My life is simple, my food is plain, and my quarters are uncluttered.
    In all things, I have sought clarity.
    I face the troubles and problems of life and death willingly.
    Virtue, integrity and courage are my priorities.
    I can be approached, but never pushed;
    befriended but never coerced;
    killed but never shamed.

    The man who would be a warrior considers it his
    most basic intention to keep death
    always in mind, day and night, from the time he first
    picks up his chopsticks
    in celebrating his morning meal on New Year's
    Day to the evening of the last day of the year.
    When one constantly keeps death in mind, both
    loyalty and filial piety are realized,
    myriad evils and disasters are avoided,
    one is without illness and mishap,
    and lives out a long life.
    In addition, even his character is improved.
    Such are the many benifits of this act.

    THE BOOK OF THE VOID
    The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.
    What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included
    in manâ€™s knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist, you can
    know that which does not exist. That is the void.
    People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not
    understand must be the void. This is not the true void. It is bewilderment.
    In the Way of strategy, also, those who study as warriors think that whatever they
    cannot understand in their craft is the void. This is not the true void.
    To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts and
    not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled, accumulate practice
    day by day, and hour by hour. Polish the twofold spirit heart and mind, and sharpen the twofold
    gaze perception and sight. When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of
    bewilderment clear away, there is the true void.
    Until you realise the true Way, whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you
    may think that things are correct and in order. However, if we look at things objectively, from
    the viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departing from the true Way. Know
    well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the Way. Enact
    strategy broadly, correctly and openly.
    Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and, taking the void as the
    Way, you will see the Way as void.
    In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existance, principle has existance,
    the Way has existance, spirit is nothingness.
