    My life is simple, my food is plain, and my quarters are uncluttered.
    In all things, I have sought clarity.
    I face the troubles and problems of life and death willingly.
    Virtue, integrity and courage are my priorities.
    I can be approached, but never pushed;
    befriended but never coerced;
    killed but never shamed.

    The man who would be a warrior considers it his
    most basic intention to keep death
    always in mind, day and night, from the time he first
    picks up his chopsticks
    in celebrating his morning meal on New Year's
    Day to the evening of the last day of the year.
    When one constantly keeps death in mind, both
    loyalty and filial piety are realized,
    myriad evils and disasters are avoided,
    one is without illness and mishap,
    and lives out a long life.
    In addition, even his character is improved.
    Such are the many benifits of this act.
