### Timing in strategy
     There is timing in everything. 
     Timing in strategy cannot be mastered without a great deal of practice.
       
     Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, 
     for they are in rhythm only if timing is good.
     Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts,  
     shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. 
     In all skills and ablilities there is timing. 
     
     There is no timing in the Void.
     There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, 
     in his thriving and declining,
     in his harmony and discord. 
     Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, 
     in the rise and fall of capital. 
     All things entail rising and falling timing. 
     You must be able to discern this. 
     In strategy there are various timing
     considerations. From the outset you must know 
     the applicable timing and the
     inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small 
     things and the fast and
     slow timings find the relevant timing, 
     first seeing the distance timing and the
     background timing. This is the main thing in strategy. 
     It is especially
     important to know the background timing, 
     otherwise your strategy will become uncertain.
     
     You win battles with the timing in the Void born of the 
     timing of cunning by  
     knowing the enemies' timing, and thus using a timing which the 
     enemy does not expect. 
       
     All the five books are chiefly concerned with timing. 
     You must train sufficiently to appreciate this. 
     
     If you practise day and night in the above Ichi school strategy, 
     your spirit will naturally broaden.
      
     This is large scale strategy and the strategy of hand to
     hand combat propagated in the world. 
     This is recorded for the first time in the
     five books of 
     Ground, Water, Fire, Wind, and the Void. 
     This is the Way for men
     who want to learn my strategy:
     
     -Do not think dishonestly.
     -The Way is in training.
     -Become aquainted with every art.
     -Know the Ways of professions.
     -Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters.
     -Develop intuitive judgement and understanding for everything.
     -Perceive those things which cannot be seen.
     -Pat attention even to trifles.
     -Do nothing which is of no use.
     
     It is important to start by setting thses broad principles in your heart, 
     and train in the Way of strategy. 
     If you do not look at things on a large scale it
     will be difficult for you to master strategy. 
     If you learn and attain this strategy you will never lose 
     even to twenty of thirty enemies.
     More than anything to start with you must set your heart on strategy
     and earnestly stick to the Way.
     You will come to be able to actually beat men in fights, and to be
     able to win with your eye. 
     Also by training you will be able to freely control your won body, 
     conquer men with your body, and with sufficient training you will
     be able to beat ten men with your spirit. 
     When you have reached this point, 
     will it not mean that you are invincible?
     
     Moreover, in large scale strategy the superior man will 
     manage many subordinates dextrously, bear himself correctly,
      govern the country and foster the people,
     thus preserving the ruler's discipline. 
     If there is a Way involving the spirit
     of not being defeated, to help oneself and gain honour, 
     it is the Way of strategy.
     
     

### CROSSING AT FORD

     "Crossing at a ford" means, for example, crossing the sea at a strait,  
     or crossing over a hundred miles of broad sea at a crossing place.   
     I believe this "crossing at a ford" occurs often in man's lifetime.  
     It means setting sail even though your friends stay in harbor, 
     knowing the route, 
     knowing the soundness of your ship and the favor  of the day.   
     When all the conditions are met, and there is perhaps a favorable wind, 
     or a tailwind, then set sail. 

     If the wind changes within a few miles of your destination, 
     you must row across the remaining distance without sail.

     If you attain this spirit, it applies to everyday life. 
     You must always think of crossing at a ford.

     You must consider this deeply.


### THE BOOK OF THE VOID

The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.
    
What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. 
It is not included in manâ€™s knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. 
By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. 
That is the void.
    
People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not
understand must be the void. 
This is not the true void. It is bewilderment.
    
In the Way of strategy, also, those who study as warriors think that whatever they
cannot understand in their craft is the void. 
This is not the true void.
    
To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts and
not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. 
    
With your spirit settled, accumulate practice day by day, and hour by hour.
    
Polish the twofold spirit heart and mind, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight.
When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment clear away, 
there is the true void.
    
Until you realise the true Way, whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you
may think that things are correct and in order. 
    
However, if we look at things objectively, from the viewpoint of laws of the world, 
we see various doctrines departing from the true Way.
Know  well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the Way.
Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.
    
Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and, taking the void as the
Way, you will see the Way as void.
    
In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existance, principle has existance,
the Way has existance, spirit is nothingness.
