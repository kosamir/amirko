### CROSSING AT FORD

     "Crossing at a ford" means, for example, crossing the sea at a strait, or crossing over a hundred miles of broad sea at a crossing       place.  
     I believe this "crossing at a ford" occurs often in man's lifetime.  
     It means setting sail even though your friends stay in harbor, knowing the route, knowing the soundness of your ship and the favor      of the day.   
     When all the conditions are met, and there is perhaps a favorable wind, or a tailwind, then set sail.  

     If the wind changes within a few miles of your destination, you must row across the remaining distance without sail.

     If you attain this spirit, it applies to everyday life. You must always think of crossing at a ford.

     You must research this well




### THE BOOK OF THE VOID

    The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.
    
    What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. 
    It is not included in manâ€™s knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. 
    By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist. That is the void.
    
    People in this world look at things mistakenly, and think that what they do not
    understand must be the void. This is not the true void. It is bewilderment.
    
    In the Way of strategy, also, those who study as warriors think that whatever they
    cannot understand in their craft is the void. This is not the true void.
    
    To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts and
    not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. 
    
    With your spirit settled, accumulate practice day by day, and hour by hour.
    
    Polish the twofold spirit heart and mind, and sharpen the twofold  gaze perception and sight.
    When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment clear away, there is the true void.
    
    Until you realise the true Way, whether in Buddhism or in common sense, you
    may think that things are correct and in order. 
    
    However, if we look at things objectively, from the viewpoint of laws of the world, 
    we see various doctrines departing from the true Way.
    Know  well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the Way.
    Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.
    
    Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and, taking the void as the
    Way, you will see the Way as void.
    
    In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existance, principle has existance,
    the Way has existance, spirit is nothingness.
