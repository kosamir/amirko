After i've sucesfully finished my childhood dream project and (more or less) 
sucessfully landed wingusit without parachute 6 years ago, 
i have decided to return MORE seriously to my previous love and that is software development.

On my free time you can find me somewhere OUT THERE working on my hardcore skillzz like
* slacklining 
* windsurfing
* hiking/climbing 
* riding a bicycle with earphones in my ears :)
