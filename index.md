Hello!!!

this is **ME**.. 

I am software architect with more than 10 years working in financial industry.
My hobies includes all kind of crazy stuf.. if you are interested you can check it out on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEX5HdbTHiak9DOg4NzSy6w) chanell.

After i've sucesfully finished my childhood dream project and (more or less) sucessfully landed wingusit without parachute 6 years ago, i have decided to return MORE seriously to my previous love and that is software development.

After couple of failed attempts with geodesy I have finished computer programing on FESB(gen 2005) afterward
s i have worked for couple off small it companies mainly as J2EE software developer.
I came to the working for financial institiution  as J2EE architect in 2006.. and i work here still after all those years :)

My expirience is mostly based on developing and integrating back end systems written in Java programing language.. with technologies like Spring, Hibernate, struts, jsf.
I am not currently working on any project with all the new toys.. .so reading a lot about cloud( aws, docker) and ocasionaly diving into endless pit  of javascript libraries like( jquerry, react, node)
Expirience with that new stuff is limited only to playing around with them to see capabilities.. but i am keen to explore them..in real projects.


I am sport and healthy nutrition enthuziast.. on my free time you can find me somewhere OUT THERE 
working on my hardcore skillzz...mainly slacklining, windsurfing, hiking/climbing or riding a bicycle with earphones in my ears :)
I like to cook in my spare time also..

If you like to know more here is link to my [CV](/data/AmirKosCV_hr.pdf) where things are little detailed.


this is only draft version i will update as soon i get some feedback.

As my good frend once said:
It is (NP-)hard to describe me.. so you got to expirience me :)

... more to come..
