Hello!!!

this is **ME**.. 

I am software architect with more than 10 years working in financial industry.
My hobies includes all kind of crazy stuf.. 
if you are interested you can check it out on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEX5HdbTHiak9DOg4NzSy6w) chanell.

After i've sucesfully finished my childhood dream project and (more or less) sucessfully landed wingusit without parachute 6 years ago, i have decided to return MORE seriously to my previous love and that is software development.

After couple of failed attempts with geodesy I have finished computer programing on FESB(gen 2005) afterward
s i have worked for couple off small it companies mainly as J2EE software developer.
I came to the working for financial institiution  as J2EE architect in 2006.. and i work here still after all those years :)

My expirience is mostly based on developing and integrating back end systems written in Java programing language.
With technologies like:
  * Spring, 
  * Hibernate 
  * Struts  
  * Jsf.
Big fan of continuos automated software build and development( Jenkins, Maven, Ant)

I am not currently working on any project with all the new toys but  reading a lot about stuff that intrigues me
*cloud( aws, docker) 

and ocasionaly diving into endless jungle of javascript libraries like: 
  * jquerry 
  * react  
  * node

Expirience with that new stuff is limited only to playing around with them to explore capabilities.. 
but also keen to explore them..in real world projects.


Aside i am sport and healthy nutrition enthuziast.. on my free time you can find me somewhere OUT THERE 
working on my hardcore skillzz...mainly slacklining, windsurfing, hiking/climbing or riding a bicycle with earphones in my ears :)
Padawan in cooking 2..

If you like to know more here is link to my [CV](/_data/AmirKosCV_hr.pdf) where things are little detailed.


As my good frend once said:
>It is (NP-)hard to describe me.. so you got to expirience me :)

this is only draft version i will update(content/look and feel) as soon i get some feedback.



... more to come..
